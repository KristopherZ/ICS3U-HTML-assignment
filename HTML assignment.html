  <h2 id="Introduction">0.Introduction </h2>
  <p>Special relativity is one of the most important theoy in modern physcis. In 1905 Albert Einstein developed 
    the theory of special relativity. This theory explains the limit on an object's speed and describes the 
    consequences. In Albert Einstein's original treatment, the theory is based on two postulates:<br>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>The laws of physics are invariant (that is, identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, 
      frames of reference with no acceleration).</li>
    <li>The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light 
      source or observer.
    </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <hr>
  <h2 id="Newtonian Physics">1.Newtonian Physics </h2>
  <h3 id="Reference Frame">1.1.Reference Frame</h3>
  <h4>1.1.1.Relativity</h4>
  <p>Nothing is absolute rest, nothing is absolute moving. Ancient people recognize that they cannot 
    distinct they are moving or not when they are on the boat. If you want to discribe your motion, 
    you have to find a reference, in physics, we call it "frame of reference".</p>
  <h4>1.1.2.Inertial Frame of Reference</h4>
  <p>An inertial frame of reference (or a rest frame) is one that is moving in uniform motion. E.i. 
    no interial force act on object in this frame of reference</p>
  <h3 id="Absolute Time">1.2.Absolute Time, Absolute Length</h3>
  <p>
  In Newtonian physics, although they recognize the motion is relative, they think time is absolute 
  and length is absolute as well. 1 secend in my frame of reference is exactly same in your frame
   of reference. 1 metre in my frame of reference is also exactly same in your frame of reference.
    This makes sense to most of people since 17th century to 20th century.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Galilean Relativity">1.3.Galilean Relativity</h3>
  One of the direct consequences of absolute time and length is Galilean relativity.<br>
  <img src="pic/Galilean Relativity.gif"><br>
  <b>The transformation follows this:</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Relative position: X<sub>AC</sub> = X<sub>AB</sub> + X<sub>BC</sub></li>
  <li>Relative velocity: V<sub>AC</sub> = V<sub>AB</sub> + V<sub>BC</sub></li>
  <li>Relative acceleration: A<sub>AC</sub> = A<sub>AB</sub> + A<sub>BC</sub></li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Properties:</b><br>
    In an inertial frame, Newton’s first and second laws of motion are valid; Since all uniform 
    motion are treated the same way, you may consider any inertial
    frames of reference to be at rest. <br> 
    <b>The Principle of Relativity: </b><br>
    All laws of motion must apply equally in all inertial frames of reference.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="Challenge">2.Challenge </h2>
  <h3 id="Maxwell's Equations">2.1.Maxwell's Equations</h3>
  <p>This is Maxwell's equations:<br>
  <img src="pic/Maxwell'sEquations.svg" width="250" height="200"><br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations" target="_blank"><em>Learn more about Maxwell's 
    Equations</em></a><br>
  The first two equations are called "Gauss' Law", it demostrates that the electric field come from 
  a e<sup>+</sup> particle to a e<sup>-</sup> particle, and magnetic field are closed pathes. 
  The thrid equation is called "Faraday's law", it shows that change of magnetic field can create 
  electric field. The fourth equation is called "Ampere's law", it reveals that change of electric 
  field can create magnetic field.<br><br>
  The most important consequence of Maxwell's equation is light is electromagnetic waves. When conbine 
  last two equations, it derives that :<br>
  c=<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>√εμ</sub>=299792458 m/s <br><br>
  However, as we mentioned before, the velocity need a frame of reference, what's the frame of 
  reference of the speed of light? The equations do not give us the answer. In addition, it has
   these peculiar features:
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Does not mention the medium in which EM waves travels</li>
    <li>When applying Galilean transformation (from which we obtain the velocity
      addition rule) to Maxwell’s equations, asymmetry is introduced</li>
    <li>Gauss’s law for magnetism break down: magnetic field lines appear to have
      beginnings/ends</li>
    <li>In some inertial frames of reference, Maxwell’s equations are simple and elegant,
      but transform the equation into another inertial frame, the equations are ugly and
      complex!</li>
    <li>Physicists at the time began to theorize that (perhaps) there is an actual preferred
      inertial frame of references</li>
    <li>This seems to violate the principle of relativity</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3 id="The Illusive Ether">2.2.The Illusive Ether</h3>
      In this case Maxwell constract a hyothesis: the speed of light c0 is relative to a hypothetical subtance called
      luminiferous aether (or just ether) that permeates the universe. Ether must have some fantastic properties:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>All space is filled with ether</li>
        <li>Massless</li>
        <li>Zero viscosity</li>
        <li>Non-dispersive</li>
        <li>Incompressible</li>
        <li>Continuous at a very small (sub-atomic) scale</li>
      </ol>
      Do you believe the existence of Ether?
  <h3 id="The Michelson-Morley Experiment">2.3.The Michelson-Morley Experiment</h3>
  <p>Please read the article from wikipedia.</p>
  <div class = MichelsonMorleyExperiment><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" style="border:none;"  title="Michelson–Morley experiment"></iframe></div>
  <br> <b>Key facts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>The experiment demonstrates that the speed of light travels horizontally and vertically is the same.</li>
    <li>Lorentz, the person who wanted to save both the theory and the experiment, he generated his Lorentz transformation:<br>
    <img src = "pic/lorentz.svg" width="250" height="200"></li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="Special Relativity">3.Special Relativity</h2>
  <img src="pic/220px-Einstein_tongue.jpg" style="float: right;">
  <p>1905 is the most thrift year in Modern Physics, Albert Einstein published his 5 most important paper. One of them is "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" - Special Relativity. 
    He construct Postulates of Special Relativity to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment:
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Principle of Relativity:</b> All laws of physics must apply equally in all
        inertial frames of reference.</li>
      <li><b>The Principle of Invariant Light Speed:</b> As measured in any inertial
        frame of reference, light always propagates in a vaccum with a definite
        velocity c0, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p>The difference in Einstein's theory:
    <ul>
      <li>The speed of light is absolute (invariant), therefore</li>
      <li>Space and time must be relative to the observer.</li>
      </ul> 
  </p>
  <h3 id = "Simultaneity">3.1.Simultaneity</h3>
  <p>The direct consequence of Einstein's theory is that change our understanding of Simultaneity.<br><br>
  <img src = "pic/simultaneity1.gif"> 
  <br>
Let's do a thought experiment. Imagining there is train runing at .5c, two beams of light shoot from the equal
 distance to the person on the train. At the Same time, there is a person stand right on the position of the person on the train. 
Due to the 'The Principle of Invariant Light Speed', the person who doesn't move see the light beams at the same time;however, 
the person on the train see the light in front of him/her before the light behind him. Therefore, the Simultaneity is actually depend the frame of reference!!!
</p>
  <h3 id = "Time Dilation">3.2.Time Dilation</h3>
  <p>Einstein is really familiar with thought experiemnt, so, let's do another one.<br>
    <img src="pic/Time-dilation-002-mod.png"><br>
    Let's assume you are on a spaceship that travels at a speed v s.t. v is close to c. Now you have two parallel mirror as showed above, 
    it photon then travels between these mirror. In you point of view, you and these mirrors are relative static, and the time cost 
    the photon to travel A-B-A is ∆t=2L/c. On the other hand, a person who is rest to the ground saw that the time cost the photon to
    travel A-B-A is ∆t'=2D/c. Moreover, by pythagorean theorem D^2=L^2+(1/2v∆t')^2. When combine these equations, we get the time dilation formula:<br>
    <img src = "pic/time dilation eq.svg" height="100" width="200"></p>
    <h4>Example1</h4>
    <p>Kim is riding a rocket that speeds past an asteroid at v = 0.600c. If Kim
      sees 10.0 s pass on her watch, how long would that time interval be as seen by Jim, an
      observer on the asteroid? (3s.f.)

    <h4>Example2</h4>
    <p>Kim is riding a rocket that speeds past an asteroid at 0.600c. If Jim, an
      observer in the asteroid, sees 10.0 s pass on his watch, how long would that time
      interval be as seen by Kim? (3s.f.)
    <button type="button" onclick="alert('16.7s')">ANSWER</button></p>
    <input type="number" id="TDp2" value=""><label style="font-size: 120%;"> sec </label><br>
    <button class="button1" onclick="TDp2fun()">Submit</button>
    <em><p id="TDp2output"></p></em>
  <h3 id = "Length Contraction">3.3.Length Contraction</h3>
    <p>The consequence of Time dilation is Length Contraction:<br>
    <img src="pic/Length Contraction 1.svg" height="80"><br>
    Therefore:<br>
    <img src="pic/Length Contraction 2.svg" height="60"></p>
    <h4>Example1</h4>
    Captain Quick is a comic book hero who can run at nearly the speed of light. In his hand,
he is carrying a bomb set to explode in 1.5 μs. The bomb must be placed into its bracket
before this happens. The distance (L) between the flare and the bracket is 402 m. How far did he travel? Can he finish the mission?
<button type="button" onclick="alert('300m')">ANSWER</button><br>
    <input type="number" id="LCp1" value=""><label style="font-size: 120%;"> m </label><br>
    <button class="button1" onclick="LCp1fun()">Submit</button>
    <em><p id="LCp1output"></p></em>
  <h3 id = "Relative Velocity">3.4.Relative Velocity</h3>
  <p>Unlike in classical mechanics, velocities (speeds) do not simply add. We have to account
    for time dilation and length contraction, which are included in the Lorentz
    transformation</p>
  <p><b>Einstein velocity addition rule:</b><br>
  <img src = "pic/Einstein velocity.svg" height="90" width="200"></p>
  <h3 id = "Relativistic Momentum">3.5.Relativistic Momentum</h3>
  <p>The defination of momentum still the same:<br>
  <img src = "pic/momentum.svg"height="60" width="120"><br>
Therefore, subsitute x with Relativistic length:<br>
<img src ="pic/momentum2.svg"height="100" width="400"></p>
  <h3 id = "Relativistic Mass">3.6.Relativistic Mass</h3>
  <p>From the relativistic momentum expression, we see the relativistic aspect to mass as
    well:<br>
    <img src="pic/mass.svg"height="100" width="200"></p>
  <h3 id = "Relativistic Energy">3.7.Relativistic Energy</h3>
  <p>The last topic is energy, and it is also the most importatn consequence of special relativity.</p>
  <p>The defination of work does not change:<br>
    <img src ="pic/work.svg" height="60" width="120">
  </p>
  <p>Therefore:<br>
  <img src ="pic/energy part 1.svg"height="60"><br>
  let:<br>
  <img src="pic/gamma.svg"height="80"><br>
  <br> Assuming that both v and p are continuous in time, we can apply the product rule:<br>
  <img src = "pic/energy part 2.svg"height="30">
  <br> sub it back to integral:<br>
  <img src="pic/energy part 3.svg"height="60">
  <br> By defination of γ:<br>
  <img src ="pic/energy part 4.svg"height="60"><br>
  sub it back:<br>
  <img src="pic/energy part 5.svg" height="60"><br>
  Therefore:<br>
  <img src="pic/energy part 6.svg"height="30">
  <br> consequencely:
  <br><img src ="pic/e=mc^2.svg" height="30">
  <br> This is the most famous eqation and it is the fundation of atomic bomb!!!
